# SimpleNetworkAnalysisTool
This is a simple tool to measure latency and throughput between two hosts. It supports both TCP and UDP. It also comes with a simple client that runs a predefined set of test suites between two hosts and outputs the results to a csv file.
I developed this tool for my CSC 445 Computer Networks course in Spring 2016.
